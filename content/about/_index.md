# Short biography

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Universit√§t Siegen, working with a bunch of topics in quantum information. My current projects are mainly related to quantum/quantum-assisted communication, network entanglement and steering. I frequently make use of convex optimization, and have a general interest in computational tools and theory. Previously, I was at the [MathFoundQ](http://www.ime.unicamp.br/~mfq/) group at University of Campinas, where I got my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Physics.

On a not-so-sciency side, I'm interested in literature, translation, copy editing and proofreading. I sporadically take related courses and, in a very distant future, I'd be happy to write/translate textbooks, layman science books or even literary fiction.
