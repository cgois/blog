# Short biography

I'm a Ph.D. student at [Universit√§t Siegen](https://www.physik.uni-siegen.de/tqo/), and I'm interested in a bunch of topics in quantum information. [My current projects](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gAc5ldUAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR&oi=ao) are mainly related to quantum/quantum-assisted communication, network entanglement and steering. I frequently make use of convex optimization, and have a general interest in computational tools and theory. Previously, I was at the [MathFoundQ](http://www.ime.unicamp.br/~mfq/) group at University of Campinas, where I got my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Physics.

On a not-so-sciency side, I'm interested in literature, translation, copy editing and proofreading. I sporadically take related courses. If science doesn't work out I would gladly be a translator of textbooks, layman science books or maybe even dare to try some literary fiction.
