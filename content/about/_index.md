# Short biography

I am a Physics M.Sc. candidate at [University of Campinas](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english), one of the top Brazilian universities, where I also got my Physics B.Sc. I'm a member of [MathFoundQ](ime.unicamp.br/~mfq), where I study quantum correlations/device independent quantum information. My current interests are in distinguishing between classicality/nonclassicality in prepare-and-measure, EPR steering and Bell non-locality scenarios. I frequently make use of convex optimization, and have a general interest in computational tools. Most of the time I write code in Python + NumPy, MATLAB or Mathematica, but I do have basic familiarity with C/C++ and Scheme. Further academic interests include quantum foundations (for instance, GPTs), all that could be said "quantum information", algorithms (both classical and quantum), the theory of computation and quantum computing.

<!--
During my undergraduate studies I had experience with scientific instrumentation (developing remote panels to automate the characterization of optoelectronic devices) and in microfabricating and characterizing semiconductor lasers. I was also an exchange student in Eötvos Loránd University. I'm a current member of MathFoundQ (Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory Group) and INCT-IQ (National Institute for Science and Technology of Quantum Information).

Apart from [MathFoundQ](http://www.ime.unicamp.br/~mfq/) (Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory Group), I am also a member of GFSMC (Many-Body Physics Group @ DFMC-Unicamp), and INCT-IQ (National Institute for Science and Technology of Quantum Information).

You can find some more details in [my CV](/CV.pdf).

# Other interests

My main interests in Physics are the foundations of quantum theory and quantum information. In my case, they walk hand-in-hand: while my main motivation to study classicality in quantum systems is to understand when and why things become quantum, the (semi-)device independent approach is intimately linked to information-theoretical applications. More recent interests are GPTs and resource theories.

I'm also keen on anything related to computers, with a tendency to the theoretical side. Iwasn't here to witness the development of classical computers, so I try to keep up with quantum computing developments as a way to see the whole computing stack being built: from qubits to transpilers and programming languages; from quantum theory to algorithms and applications.

On a not-so-sciency side, I'm interested in literature, translation, copy editing and proofreading. I sporadically take related courses and, in a very distant future, I'd be happy to write/translate textbooks, layman science books or even literary fiction.
